<blockquote>With over two decades of hands-on experience, I've cultivated a profound understanding of various GNU/Linux distributions, spanning from DamnSmallLinux and PuppyLinux to heavyweights like RedHat (RHEL), Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Deepin, and the esteemed ArchLinux. While many distributions share similar architectures and layouts, my expertise delves into the nuances that make each one distinct.
In addition, I'm well-versed in L.A.M.P. and other crucial technologies, fully embracing the dynamic landscape of today's internet, which is besieged by relentless automated threats. Adaptability is key in effectively countering these cyber threats, and I continuously strive to stay ahead by sharing top-tier insights garnered from my ongoing journey.
My knowledge extends beyond software to encompass hardware intricacies as well, enriching my understanding of the intricate interplay between technology components.
 I'm talented across many skills. I did most of this website myself with a little assistance from chatgpt. I have good luck repairing my personal vehicles, a personal garage would be nice, I would have a spot to do more detailed repair or car modding. I do much of my vehicle repairs myself.
