About This Site ‚Äî and Who's Behind It

This site, like most of my infrastructure, is built by hand ‚Äî with a healthy respect for the command line and just enough AI assist to keep things spicy. It runs on a foundation of open-source muscle and experience earned over two decades in the Linux trenches.

I've worked with everything from lightweight classics like Damn Small Linux and PuppyLinux to production-grade beasts like Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, Fedora, and Deepin. I don't just use these systems ‚Äî I break them, rebuild them, automate them, and optimize them until they hum.

This isn‚Äôt just a web presence ‚Äî it‚Äôs a live, evolving testbed. I run:

    Arch, Proxmox, Ubuntu, and TrueNAS SCALE systems across my stack

    Tailscale for mesh VPNs and remote exit node control

    Cloudflare Tunnels to securely expose services like Postfix, Dovecot, Friendica, and custom APIs

    Pi-hole for DNS-level blocking, Unbound for recursion, and Fail2Ban for the bots that don‚Äôt get the message

Everything‚Äôs self-hosted. If it can be containerized or VM'd, it probably is. I script what I need, patch what breaks, and log what matters.
üõ†Ô∏è Skills That Stick

    Built my own Friendica instance (urbanmind.net) with add-ons, federation tuning, and BBCode-rich profile customization

    Maintain multiple Raspberry Pi nodes running Debian 12 Bookworm and RPi kernel 6.x for DNS, IoT, and internal services

    Created tools like exitnode (Tailscale CLI switcher) and safeedit (timestamped script editing system) for my daily workflow

    Recovered lost partitions with TestDisk, tuned VM performance with CPU pinning, and migrated qcow2 images with qemu-img ‚Äî in production

    If it can break, I‚Äôve probably fixed it already. If it‚Äôs undocumented, I‚Äôll reverse-engineer it anyway.

üß∞ Also...

I repair and maintain my own vehicles because problem-solving doesn‚Äôt end with a reboot. Given a garage, I'd mod the hell out of them too. Until then, the same mindset applies: investigate, adapt, improve.
